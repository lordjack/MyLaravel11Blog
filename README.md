In this video I walk you through Laravel 11 Broadcasting. The focus of this video is on Laravel Reverb. We will Implement broadcasting on different channels i.e Public and Private channels. 

Laravel Reverb brings blazing-fast and scalable real-time WebSocket communication directly to your Laravel application. So lets start!

Laravel’s event broadcasting allows you to broadcast your server-side Laravel events to your client-side JavaScript application using a driver-based approach to WebSockets.

The events may be easily consumed on the client-side using the Laravel Echo JavaScript package.

Events are broadcast over “channels“, which may be specified as public or private. Any visitor to your application may subscribe to a public channel without any authentication or authorization; however, in order to subscribe to a private channel, a user must be authenticated and authorized to listen on that channel.
